                    <div class="post-content"><p>Meet FromMeToYou, a small but big project designed to bring the community together in outstanding ways, and by connecting the dontators to the reciepients we can give people a bigger sense of connection to the people and world around them.</p><br><br><p>Housing in Loudoun County is expensive. Jobs aren't everlasting. Deaths can take a toll on income. A medical issue can drain savings. And even a whole family can be pushed to the sidewalks, barely getting by every day. This is a problem, inevitably created when we institute a capitalist system on the people (But that is a story for another time). What we are trying to do with FromMeToYou is raise awareness for awareness in Loudoun County, where out of the multitude of people we’ve asked, only one had agreed that Loudoun County has a growing homelessness problem that needs to be recognized by the people that can do something to help.</p><br><br>

	<p>We are working to change the common narrative of foodless homeless people, because we feel that as a society, anyone should feel the need to help anyone else that needs it, and helping is a primal instinct. We’ve been helping one another for centuries, this is why, unlike other species, we decided to stay as a group, hunt as a group, and work together as a group to stay alive, and we feel that in modern day we shouldn’t look away from these readily apparent problems just as we didn’t in the past.</p><br><br>

	<p>FromMeToYou is a food pantry project where we will set up our boxes throughout the county, and people can donate food to them. All of the boxes are connected through the app, and so anyone who feels like donating can fire up the app at any time, and get their closest box. When you drop off food, you turn on a light signaling to anyone that needs the food that there is some available. For people to be able to donate directly to the box, and have the possibility of the box being empty the next day, is an amazing feeling that is amplified by our direct donation system.</p><br><br>

<p>The biggest push with FromMeToYou for me is the fact that we can connect the donator to the donee. The power in this idea lies in the fact that if people see that their actions can directly make a difference, they can be pushed to do more good. And if they aren’t pushed to do more, they can still take away the fact that they always have the opportunity to do something that can really matter to their fellow human being.</p><br><br>

	<p>Currently we are constructing two boxes that are set to be released in upcoming weeks, and we will begin advertising then, working at schools, libraries, supermarkets, and sidewalks alike, trying our best to get the word out, because I feel that even if only one person is helped it is still as much as a success as if a hundred are.</p><br><br>

	<p>We will be releasing our website, FaceBook page, and GoFundMe very soon, so please stay updated for my next post and contact me <a href="http://crucialnet.org/contact-me" class="post-link">here</a> for any further inquiries.</p>
